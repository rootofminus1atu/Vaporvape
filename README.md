# Vaporvape
This is my Year 1 Semester 2 Web development project at ATU. It's about a fictional vape shop. The design was inspired by the vaporwave/synthwave/retrowave aesthetic.

# Thoughts

I'm mostly happy with how the website looks like, but it could look better. What I'm not happy about is how the CSS is managed. It's kind of a mess and it's definitely not the way to go for such visually-demanding projects in the future. Next time I'm planning to use *tailwindcss* and some global CSS, or CSS modules (especially when working with frameworks in the future).
